Using PHP, please create a command line application that will accept a name and an animal type. On receiving the input, the application should respond with an appropriate message from that animal. For example, 
* php AnimalProject.php "Mr Pickles" cat *
Mr Pickles says "meow" 
- The application must use object inheritance for its implementation 
- The application should support at least the following animals: 
- cat (output: <name> says "meow") 
- dog (output: <name> says "woof") 
- cow (output: <name> says "moo") 
- The application should not fail when an unknown animal name is received
